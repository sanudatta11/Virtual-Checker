This is the sample repository for Kone Hackathon for Team Stuxnet

The first folder contaiins the codes written in android studio for an android app  that we have used as pressure sensor for the elevator floor.
The android app shows a simulation of pressure sensor and sends the value of pressure points to the raspberry pi.

The second folder contains the codes of an web app that simulates an elevator that has been integrated with our authentication system. This facilitates us to have a look of all the possible cases that may occur while people are getting inside or coming outside of the elevator. 

The third file contains the code of a personal assistance that we have built using IBM Watson apis and the same is supposed to be installed inside our elevators. It can answer basic questions about weather, local foods and services that the hotel has to offer to us.

Finally the last file contains the python code of the entire authentication system designed by us using raspberry pi and Watson apis.
